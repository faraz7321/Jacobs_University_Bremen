* Example proof by contra-positive

  Theorem: Let x be an element of ℤ. If x^2 - 6x + 5 is even, then x is
           odd.

  Formalization:  ∀ x ∈ ℤ.even(x^2 - 6x + 5) ⇒ odd(x)

  Proof: The contra-positive of the proposition is the following:

           ∀ x ∈ ℤ.even(x) ⇒ odd(x^2 - 6x + 5)

         Since x is even, there exists a k ∈ ℤ such that 2k = x.
         Substituting x, we get:

           x^2 - 6x + 5 = (2k)^2 - 6(2k) + 5
                        = 4k^2 - 12k + 5
                        = 4k^2 - 12k + 4 + 1
                        = 2(2k^2 - 6k + 2) + 1

         Since the first term is even, the sum must be odd.

* Example proof of if and only if using two implications

  Theorem: n - 5 is odd if and only if 3n + 2 is even

  Formalization:   ∀ n ∈ ℤ.odd(n - 5) ⇔ even(3n + 2)

  Proof: First, we show that if n - 5 is odd, then 3n + 2 is even.
         Since n - 5 = (n - 4) - 1 is odd, we know that n - 4 is
         even. This implies that n must be an even number. Lets write
         n as 2k for some k in ℤ. Now we get

           3n + 2 = 3(2k) + 2
                  = 2 (3k + 1)

         which obviously is even.

         Next, we show that if 3n + 2 is even, then n - 5 is odd.
         Since we add add an even number to 3n, it follows that 3n
         must be even. Since 3 is odd, n must be equal to 2k for some
         k in ℤ. This gives us

           n - 5 = 2k - 5
                 = 2(k - 2) - 1

         which is odd.

* Example proof by contradiction

  Theorem: There is no smallest rational number greater than 0.

  Proof: We assume that r is the smallest rational number greater than
         0. Then r/2 is also a rational number and r/2 < r, which
         contradicts that r is the smallest rational number.

* Example proof by induction

  Lets define an ancestor tree of a person inductively.

  (1) In the simplest case, an ancestor tree is one person.

  (2) In the general case, an ancestor tree shows a person connected
      to two parents, with each parent having an ancestor tree.

  Theorem: Let n denote the number of persons in an ancestor tree. An
           ancestor tree extending over g generations shows at most
           2^g - 1 persons, i.e., n ≤ 2^g - 1.

  Proof: We proof the theorem by induction.

  - Base case:

    We consider a person with no knowledge about his/her parents. In
    this case, we have g = 1 and n = 1. We have to check whether the
    inequality n ≤ 2^g - 1 holds:

      1 = n ≤ 2^g - 1 = 2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1

    This shows that the inequality holds for an ancestor tree with a
    single person.

  - Induction step:

    We consider a person with two parents and the two ancestor trees
    of the parents cover g and h generations. Let m = max(g,h) be the
    maximum of the generations of the two ancestor trees.

    The ancestor tree of our person covers m+1 generations and we can
    assume (due to the induction hypothesis) that every parent's tree
    has at most 2^m - 1 persons.

    With this, we get for the tree covering m+1 generations:

    n = (2^g - 1) + (2^h - 1) + 1 ≤ (2^m - 1) + (2^m - 1) + 1
                                  = 2(2^m - 1) + 1
                                  = 2^(m+1) - 2 + 1
                                  = 2^(m+1) - 1

    It follows by induction, that the claim is true for arbitrary
    ancestor trees.

* Hint for working out induction steps: It is often useful to work out
  how the result you need to get at looks like. In our case, we need
  to arrive at n ≤ 2^(m+1) - 1. Knowing the goal sometimes makes it
  easier to find a way to get there.
