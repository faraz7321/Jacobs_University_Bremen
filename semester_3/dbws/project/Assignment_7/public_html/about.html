                    This website serves as the project for the Databases and Web Services course,
                    taught in the 3rd semester by Prof Peter Baumann. The website represents a Product
                    Management System which can be implemented within an office environment. The System
                    consists of employees who can make requests to borrow some office equipment, and admins
                    that can view and handle these requests. This frontend is to be connected with a 
                    database storing information about all employees, including admins, and information about
                    all the available products that can be borrowed.
