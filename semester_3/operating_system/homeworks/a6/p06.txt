Q2 b)

    b.c: f()
    b.c: g()
    a.c: h()
    a.c: g()
    a.c: f()

    c)
    all C style header files (stdio.h, string.h, etc) have their declarations in the extern “C” block.
    1. Since C++ supports function overloading, additional information has to be added to function names 
    (called Name mangling) to avoid conflicts in binary code. 
    2. Function names may not be changed in C as it doesn’t support function overloading. 
    To avoid linking problems, C++ supports the extern “C” block. C++ compiler makes sure that names 
    inside the extern “C” block are not changed.
