* Overview

  The graph defined below defines the relation of concepts we have
  discussed in class meetings...

  digraph math {

      edge [label=" is-a"];

      "relation" -> "cartesian product" [label=" subset-of",style="dashed"];

      "binary relation" -> "relation";
      "unary relation" -> "relation";
      "k-ary relation (k>2)" -> "relation";

      "equivalence relation" -> "binary relation";
      "partial order relation" -> "binary relation";
      "strict partial order relation" -> "binary relation";

      "linear order relation" -> "partial order relation";

      "function" -> "binary relation";
      "partial function" -> "function";
      "total function" -> "function";

      "injective function" -> "function";
      "surjective function" -> "function";
      "bijective function" -> "function";
  }

* Examples

  a, b \in N:   a = b   (a,b) \in =     equivalence relation
                a < b   (a,b) \in <     strict partial order
                a <= b  (a,b) \in <=    partial order
