a)

E0020	identifier "string" is undefined
E0020	identifier "cout" is undefined
E0020	identifier "endl" is undefined
E0020	identifier "getline" is undefined
E0020	identifier "cin" is undefined

Using namespace, you can define the context 
in which names are defined. In essence, a namespace defines a scope.

eg string is a part of std namespace so instead of
- using namespace std;
- string xyz = "hello";
- cout << xyz;

+ std::string xyz = "hello"; 
+ std::cout << xyz;
can be used

b)

E0020	identifier "name" is undefined

name variable is undefined so we need to use Class::method
to access the class member in a method which is outside of the class.
If we dont want to write 
- void Critter::setName(string& newname)
we can write the method inside the Critter class
+ void setName(string& newname)

if we write
void setHunger(int newhunger) {
	Critter::hunger = newhunger;
}
this is wrong because we are accessing private member of the class
