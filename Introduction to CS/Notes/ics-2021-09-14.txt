* Example proof by derivation

  Theorem: For all integers a, b, and c, if a divides b (a|b) and b
           divides c (b|c), then a divides c (a|c).

  We can formalize this theorem as follows:
  
           ∀ a,b,c ∈ ℤ.((a|b) ∧ (b|c)) ⇒ (a|c)

  Proof: Let a, b, and c be integers. Lets assume that a divides b and
         that b divides c. In other words, b is a multiple of a and c
         is a multiple of b. This means we can find integers k and j
         such that b = ka and c = jb. Combining these through
         substitution, we get:

           c = j b          | substitution of b by ka
             = j (ka)       | commutativity of multiplication
             = (jk) a

         Since jk is an integer, it follows that c is a multiple of
         a. This finally shows that a divides c, a|c.

* Example proof by contrapositive

  Lets proof Theorem 2 using its contrapositive. Assume that the
  function odd() is true whenever a number is odd and the function
  even() is true whenever a number is even. We start by stating the
  theorem formally.
  
    ∀ x,y ∈ ℤ.(odd(x) ∧ odd(y)) ⇒ odd(xy)
  
  To prove the contrapositive, we have to negate and swap the
  implication.

    ∀ x,y ∈ ℤ.¬odd(xy) ⇒ ¬(odd(x) ∧ odd(y))

  Given that even() is the same as ¬odd, we can rewrite this as
  follows:

    ∀ x,y ∈ ℤ.even(xy) ⇒ even(x) ∨ even(y)

  This can now be proven easily. We will later talk in more detail why
  the negation of ¬(odd(x) ∧ odd(y)) equals even(x) ∨ even(y).
