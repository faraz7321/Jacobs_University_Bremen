let me introduce my self
my name is faraz ahmad and i am a first year student
of computer science.

Art of solving problemss using mathematics, stat
data science if one would ask its called Algorithms
algorithms in plain English i would say its logic basically
it takes in data and spits out predictions or results

we can write logic of our own but we usually find right algorithm
from a library and tune it for our use

former CEo of google said that five exabytes of data was created since 
the dawn of humanity uptil 2003. and now this amount of data is 
generated every two days

todays technology allow us to handle, process and analyze all the
best amount of information with the help of Artificial intelligence 
and machine learning

now its used in personilzed ads, medical, health care and diagnosis
even predicting political revolutions

in machine learning we basically design, we devalope, we test,
and we evaluate algorithm which can learn from the data
and extract knowledge to make predictions into future

a class of machine learning is deep learning which is inspired 
by natural neurons of human brain
it is a network structure which has many many connections
and most the classification problems are solved with the 
concept of deep learning

i have been reading quit a few articles by Sebastian Thurn, 
a german-american computer from
